  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

  <p id="one">The Power of Persistence: Why You Should Never Give Up

    In the journey of life, we all face obstacles and challenges that test our resolve and determination. While it might be tempting to throw in the towel when the going gets tough, it's precisely during these moments that the seeds of greatness are sown. Persistence is not just a trait of successful individuals; it's the bedrock of all significant achievements. Here's why you should never give up, no matter how insurmountable the odds may seem.
    
    Embrace the Struggle Every setback and failure is a stepping stone towards your goal. It's easy to see failure as a negative outcome, but each one offers a valuable lesson. Thomas Edison famously said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." This mindset turned his persistence into the invention of the light bulb, a creation that revolutionized the world. Embrace the struggle as a necessary part of the process. Each challenge is an opportunity to learn, grow, and improve.
    
    Stay Focused on Your Vision Having a clear vision of what you want to achieve can guide you through the toughest times. Visualize your goals vividly and remind yourself why you started in the first place. This vision can serve as your North Star, keeping you on track even when everything else seems uncertain. When you stay focused on your ultimate goal, the hurdles along the way become temporary inconveniences rather than insurmountable barriers.
    
    Small Steps Lead to Big Results It's easy to get overwhelmed by the magnitude of your dreams. Break them down into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them one at a time. Celebrate each small victory along the way, as these are the building blocks of your larger success. Consistent effort, no matter how small, compounds over time and brings you closer to your goals. As the saying goes, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
    
    Find Inspiration in Others You're not alone on this journey.

    Countless individuals have faced and overcome the same obstacles you're encountering. Read biographies, watch documentaries, and listen to stories of those who have triumphed against the odds. Their experiences can provide valuable insights and serve as a source of inspiration. If they can persevere and succeed, so can you.
    
    The Power of Positive Thinking Your mindset plays a crucial role in your ability to persevere. Cultivate a positive attitude and believe in your ability to succeed. Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations and focus on what you can control. Optimism can fuel your motivation and give you the strength to keep going, even when the path ahead is unclear.
    
    Surround Yourself with Support The people you surround yourself with can significantly impact your journey. Seek out those who believe in you and your vision, and who will provide encouragement and support when you need it most. A strong support system can make all the difference, offering a shoulder to lean on and helping you stay accountable to your goals.
    
    Conclusion Persistence is the key to unlocking your full potential. No matter how many times you stumble, the important thing is to get back up and keep moving forward. Remember, every great achievement started with someone who refused to give up. Let your determination be the driving force that propels you towards success. Stay focused, stay positive, and never, ever give up. </p>
